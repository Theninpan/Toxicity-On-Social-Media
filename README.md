# Toxicity-On-Social-Media
Detect, Analyze and classify Toxic comments on online platform 

## OBJECTIVES:
Our main objective is to detect, classify and analyse toxicity that prevails among social media platform these days. A large proportion of online comments present on public domains are usually constructive, however a significant proportion are toxic in nature. Hurting other people, especially when it was uncalled for is one of the cruellest forms of sin done by mankind. We would like to classify the good from the bad, then classify the stages of toxicity. We believe that this will minimizes the type of unintended bias with respect to mentions of identities and reduce toxicity on social media.

## METHODOLOGY/TECHNIQUES PLANNED 
We are collecting and studying the various datasets online and combining useful data to get our own input dataset. Our main objective is to analyse various comments from the datasets provided and detect all the toxic comments and after detecting them we are classifying them based on the type of toxicity.

• Toxic (simply)

• severe_toxic (severely using hate speech)

• obscene (inappropriate content and messages)
